    #     awarder: Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
    #     url: https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/einstein/biographical/
    #     summary: The Nobel Prizes are five separate prizes that, according to Alfred Nobel's will of 1895, are awarded to 'those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.'

    #   - title: Max Planck Medal
    #     authors:

    #     date: 2029
    #     awarder: German Physical Society
    #     summary: Awarded for outstanding scientific achievement

    # Publications:
    #   - title: Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper
    #     authors:
    #       - Albert Einstein
    #     publisher: Annalen der Physik
    #     releaseDate: 1905-06-30
    #     url: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:On_the_Electrodynamics_of_Moving_Bodies
    #     summary: It concerned an interpretation of the Michelson–Morley experiment and the properties of light and time. Special relativity incorporates the principle that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers regardless of the state of motion of the source.

    #   - title: Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt
    #     authors:
    #       - Albert Einstein
    #     publisher: Annalen der Physik
    #     releaseDate: 1905-03-18
    #     url: https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Über_einen_die_Erzeugung_und_Verwandlung_des_Lichtes_betreffenden_heuristischen_Gesichtspunkt
    #     summary: In the second paper, he applied the quantum theory to light to explain the photoelectric effect. In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.

    #   - title: Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie

    #     url: https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_Grundlage_der_allgemeinen_Relativitätstheorie
    #     summary: The publication of the theory of general relativity made him internationally famous. He was professor of physics at the universities of Zurich (1909–1911) and Prague (1911–1912), before he returned to ETH Zurich (1912–1914).
