  abstract   = {This article provides an overview of a monitoring application, its testing and validation process. The application was developed for the detection of sub-synchronous oscillations in power systems, utilizing real-time measurements from phasor measurement units (PMUs). It uses two algorithms simultaneously to both detect the frequency at which the oscillatory event occurs and the level of energy in the oscillations. The application has been developed and tested in the framework of SmarTS Lab, an environment capable of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. The necessary components of the real-time chain of data acquisition are presented in this paper, as well as testing and validation results, to demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring tool and the feasibility of fast prototyping for real-time PMU measurements based applications using the SmarTS Lab environment.},
