  abstract = {BabelFish (BF) is a real-time data mediator for development and fast prototyping of synchrophasor applications. BF is compliant with the synchrophasor data transmission IEEE Std C37.118.2-2011. BF establishes a TCP/IP connection with any Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) or Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) stream and parses the IEEE Std C37.118.2-2011 frames in real-time to provide access to raw numerical data in the LabVIEW environment. Furthermore, BF allows the user to select ``data-of-interest'' and transmit it to either a local or remote application using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in order to support both unicast and multicast communication. In the power systems Wide Area Monitoring Protection and Control (WAMPAC) domain, BF provides the first Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) for the purpose of giving the users tools for fast prototyping of new applications processing PMU measurements in their chosen environment, thus liberating them of time consuming synchrophasor data handling and allowing them to develop applications in a modular fashion, without a need of a large and monolithic synchrophasor software environment.},

The main objective of the work package is to deploy a state-of-the-art software and hardware for developing power system operation, protection, control and automation applications. Several PMUs have been deployed at partner universities and a network of synchrophasors has been set up. In addition the Smart Transmission System Laboratory (SmarTS-Lab) has been established. This laboratory serves as a test-bench to develop and verify smart transmission grid technologies. A software development kit (S3DK) was developed within the project. The S3DK has been used to implement PMU-based applications and deploy them in different targets, including smart phones and tablets. Several tools and software applications which utilize synchrophasor measurements (from the laboratory or the deployed university PMU network) to perform power system monitoring, sub-synchronous power oscillation detection, etc., have been developed and are presented herein.},

One drawback of mode estimators that use centralized mode architecture is that the observability and therefore estimation of important low-damped local electromechanical modes can be affected by the higher observability of other dominant modes of the systems (e.g inter-area modes). This work proposes, implements and tests a decentralized architecture in order to increase the observation capability to provide better estimates of local low damped oscillations. In this architecture, the data from a single PMU or a group of local PMUs could be processed by a processor to estimate the modal parameters observed at a specific part of the grid or observed by specific group of PMUs. The decentralized architecture and results of tests are presented in this paper together with comparison with a centralized architecture.},

  abstract = {Electrical power systems continue to grow in size and complexity, resulting in new challenges to control and stabilize them. Measurement based Wide-Area Control Systems (WACS) have been extensively researched in the last decade to enhance power system stability. However, very few WACS implementations in the field have been carried out so far. To bridge this gap the LabVIEW package, Audur, presented in this paper, allows users to easily implement their custom WACS design on a National Instruments hardware platform. The hardware controller receives synchrophasor measurements compliant with the IEEE C37.118.2 protocol and generates a control signal that, in principle, can be configured as a supplementary control system to drive any active component in the power system.},

  abstract = {The iTesla Power Systems Library (iPSL) is a Modelica package providing a set of power system components for phasor time-domain modeling and simulation. The Modelica language provides a systematic approach to develop models using a formal mathematical description, that uniquely specifies the physical behavior of a component or the entire system. Furthermore, the standardized specification of the Modelica language (Modelica Association [1]) enables unambiguous model exchange by allowing any Modelica-compliant tool to utilize the models for simulation and their analyses without the need of a specific model transformation tool. As the Modelica language is being developed with open specifications, any tool that implements these requirements can be utilized. This gives users the freedom of choosing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of their choice. Furthermore, any integration solver can be implemented within a Modelica tool to simulate Modelica models. Additionally, Modelica is an object-oriented language, enabling code factorization and model re-use to improve the readability of a library by structuring it with object-oriented hierarchy. The developed library is released under an open source license to enable a wider distribution and let the user customize it to their specific needs. This paper describes the iPSL and provides illustrative application examples.},

  abstract = {This article presents an open data repository, the methodology to generate it and the associated data processing software developed to consolidate an hourly snapshot historical data set for the year 2015 to an equivalent Nordic power grid model (aka Nordic 44), the consolidation was achieved by matching the model׳s physical response w.r.t historical power flow records in the bidding regions of the Nordic grid that are available from the Nordic electricity market agent, Nord Pool. The model is made available in the form of CIM v14, Modelica and PSS/E (Siemens PTI) files. The Nordic 44 model in Modelica and PSS/E were first presented in the paper titled ``iTesla Power Systems Library (iPSL): A Modelica library for phasor time-domain simulations'' (Vanfretti et al., 2016) [1] for a single snapshot. In the digital repository being made available with the submission of this paper (SmarTSLab\_Nordic44 Repository at Github, 2016) [2], a total of 8760 snapshots (for the year 2015) that can be used to initialize and execute dynamic simulations using tools compatible with CIM v14, the Modelica language and the proprietary PSS/E tool are provided. The Python scripts to generate the snapshots (processed data) are also available with all the data in the GitHub repository (SmarTSLab\_Nordic44 Repository at Github, 2016) [2]. This Nordic 44 equivalent model was also used in iTesla project (iTesla) [3] to carry out simulations within a dynamic security assessment toolset (iTesla, 2016) [4], and has been further enhanced during the ITEA3 OpenCPS project (iTEA3) [5]. The raw, processed data and output models utilized within the iTesla platform (iTesla, 2016) [4] are also available in the repository. The CIM and Modelica snapshots of the ``Nordic 44'' model for the year 2015 are available in a Zenodo repository.},

The toolbox has been developed with modularity and extensibility in mind, using MATLAB/SIMULINK as a plug-in environment, where different tasks of the identification process are carried out. The identification process uses different optimization algorithms to improve the fitting of the model's response to selected criteria. The modular architecture of RAPID gives users complete freedom to extend and adapt the software to their needs, e.g. to implement or link external solvers for simulation or optimization. The compatibility with Modelica models is brought by the use of technologies compliant with the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard.},

The application was developed for the detection of sub-synchronous oscillations in power systems, utilizing real-time measurements from phasor measurement units (PMUs). It uses two algorithms simultaneously to both detect the frequency at which the oscillatory event occurs and the level of energy in the oscillations. The application has been developed and tested in the framework of SmarTS Lab, an environment capable of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. The necessary components of the real-time chain of data acquisition are presented in this paper, as well as testing and validation results, to demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring tool and the feasibility of fast prototyping for real-time PMU measurements based applications using the SmarTS Lab environment. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.},
