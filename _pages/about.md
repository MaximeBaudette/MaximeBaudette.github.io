Hi there,

I'm Maxime Baudette, an Energy Technology researcher at the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)](https://eta.lbl.gov/people/Maxime-Baudette) in Berkeley, CA. I'm also a PhD candidate at the [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se) in Stockholm, Sweden.

My research focuses on the application of synchronized phasor measurements (synchrophasors) to power system monitoring, control, and model calibration. At LBNL, I work on advanced distribution grid control using Distributed Energy Resources (DER), including extremum seeking-based control algorithms and phasor-based control methods.

You can find my publications below (selected papers) and a full list on the [publications](/publications/) page. My structured CV is available at [/cv/](/cv/).
