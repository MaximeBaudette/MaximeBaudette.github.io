	\cvitem{Supervisor}{Professor Luigi Vanfretti}
	\cvitem{Description}{
		The network operation process aims to make a higher use of simulation tools with the purpose of being able to take preventive decision in the operation of the power network. This requires however a strong confidence in the models used, which can only be achieved with calibration and validation for a specific purpose. \newline
		This project focuses on the development of methods and a working prototype for near real-time model validation for small signal stability studies.
		The project will make use of PMU measurements and parameter estimation methods to calibrate models, from which the modes will be determined. Once the modes from the calibrated model match the ones determined from the measurements, the model will be considered as validated for this instant. \newline
		Validated models can be used for several purposes and in a second time of the project, one example will be investigated. The validated models will be used to redesign certain control schemes of the power system.
